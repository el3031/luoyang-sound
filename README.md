# luoyang-sound

This summer, I joined the [Digital Luoyang](https://camlab.fas.harvard.edu/Digital-Luoyang) project at Harvard's Chinese Art Media Lab. Last year, the lab created a visual model of Luoyang, the political and cultural capital of China during the Northern Wei dynasty. This year, our goal was to recreate ancient Luoyang through its sounds––an aural model.

Working with a talented team of sound engineers and UI designers, I used **Unity 3D** and its particle systems to create a 3D interactive model of Luoyang city. Though a few bugs need to be worked out and the text needs to be translated to make an English version, we look forward to publishing this project in **October**!

In the meantime, check out some screenshots of the interactive space
